# Roman_Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

There are six instances where subtraction is used:

 - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
 - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
 - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
